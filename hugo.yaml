          I spent 2 academic years as a teaching assistant for the Operating Systems (CSCI 442) course at Colorado school of Mines. Many students consider
          this to be the most challenging course in the CS curriculum, as it requires students to immediately immerse themselves in using the C language
          and the Linux operating system, and requires them to code more at a lower level than any prior course got near to.

          As a teaching assistant, I provided support for the programming projects, which were:
          - An implementation of the tac command
          - Implementing a shell that supports IO redirection and pipelining
          - Creating a multi-threaded text compression program using pthreads
          - Simulating process scheduling using the following algorithms: FCFS, Round Robbin, SPN, Priority, and MLFQ
          - Simulating memory accesses using several algorithms

          Additionally, during my second year, me and one other were put in charge of managing the gradescope autograder tooling, which used Docker and
          a variety of scripting tools to produce JSON documents that were fed to gradescope for grades. We were responsible for troubleshooting,
          maintaining, and improving the grading tooling and creating documentation for future generations of TAs.
